# PianoTileGame

I made this game in a few hours, basically as a warm up before I start working on some larger projects.  The game is made in Python 3.4 and uses PyGame.

Instructions:
Press Q, W, E, or R based on the position of the tile at the bottom.  Hitting the correct button will give you 2 points and move on to the next, hitting the wrong button will take away a point. There is an infinite number of tiles, randomly generated every time. The game ends after 1 minute of starting, and the high score is saved in a text file titled scores.  

WARNING:
There is a bug where the score file will break and the game will be unable to run if you force quit the game in the middle of a run. This shouldn't happen though and I didn't realize until after finalizing everything, so the bug will stay.  Whoops.
